### 7. Machine learning in R and Python (self exploration and overview)

There are 3 types of learning: **supervised learning** **unsupervised learning** **reinforcement learning**

  1) Supervised learning

  * Regression: output is a real number or vector 
  * Classification: output is a class label
  *Note that: Decision tree seldom use alone, it’s very sensitive but explainable.*
  Method:
  
Regression | Classification | Both
--- | --- |---
Linear regression(and it's family, polynomial and GLM), <br>gradient descent | Logistic regression| Naïve naive bayes (easy to try),<br> K-nearest neighbors (KNN), <br> Random forest,<br>artificial neural network,<br>Gradient boost tree (kind of a decision tree), <br>SVM: primary use for classification

  2) Unsupervised learning
  
  *Note that: If we are doing clustering it’s better do the normalization and dimension reduction then to do the clustering*
  
  * Clustering: K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering
  * Dimension reduction: PCA, SVD(singular value decomposition)
   
 #### Specific topics:
  * Feature selection: Wrapper methods (forward, backward, and stepwise selection),  Filter methods (ANOVA, Pearson correlation, variance thresholding), Embedded methods (Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree)
  * PCA transformation
  * [manage Time series data](https://github.com/Yuhsuant1994/DataScienceTechInstitute/tree/master/TimeSeries)
  * NLP
  * Image image recognition

  * Principle Linked Data
  * RDF
  * SPARQL
  * RDFS + OWL

### 8. Hadoop [(see folder)](https://github.com/Yuhsuant1994/DataScienceTechInstitute/tree/master/Hadoop)
  
  * HDFS
