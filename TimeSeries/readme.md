# Time Series
follow the edX corse FA18: Time Series Analysis using R

  **Data:** ![Y_t](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Y_t) where t indexes time (minute, hour, day...)

  **Model:** ![model](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Y_t%3Dm_t&plus;s_t&plus;X_t)
   * ![mt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_t) is a trend component
   * ![st](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s_t) is a seasonality component with known periodicity d(![dforum](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s_t%3Ds_%7Bt&plus;d%7D)) such that ![f](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Eds_j%3D0)
   * ![Xt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_t) is a stationary component (its probability distribution does not change with shifted in time
  
  **Approach:** ![mt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_t) and ![st](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s_t) are first estimated and subtracted from ![Yt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Y_t) to have left the stationary process ![Xt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_t) to be model using time series modeling approaches.
